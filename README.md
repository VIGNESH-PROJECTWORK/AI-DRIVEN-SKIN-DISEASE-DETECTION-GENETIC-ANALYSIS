Skin Disease Diagnosis and Genetic Risk Assessment

Overview
This project aims to develop a mobile application that leverages machine learning to diagnose skin diseases, assess genetic risk, and provide seamless referrals. Focused on skin conditions like Psoriasis and Eczema, which have genetic links, the app is designed to alleviate patient anxiety by providing instant, accurate diagnosis and connecting users with specialists for timely treatment.

Key Features
Image-Based Disease Detection: Utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to analyze user-uploaded images of skin conditions, providing instant and accurate predictions of diseases like Psoriasis and Eczema.
Genetic Risk Assessment: Evaluates the user’s genetic predisposition to predicted skin diseases based on known risk factors, helping patients make informed decisions about their health.
Seamless Referral System: Automatically connects users with specialized healthcare professionals based on the predicted diagnosis, reducing wait times and ensuring timely access to personalized care.

Algorithms Used
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image classification
Genetic Risk Assessment Model for predicting genetic predisposition

Usage
To use the Skin Disease Diagnosis app:
Download and install the app from the provided link.
Upload an image of the skin condition for analysis.
Receive an instant diagnosis of the skin condition.
Review the genetic risk assessment to understand your predisposition to the disease.
If necessary, get a referral to a specialist for further consultation and treatment.

Results
The model’s performance is evaluated using metrics like accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. The results are presented within the app interface, and visualizations are used to display model predictions and confidence levels in the diagnosis.
